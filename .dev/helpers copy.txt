A complex task that involves several components, would be best to be approached
by using a combination of design patterns and other good programming pratices 
as listed bellow:
1. **Facade Pattern**: This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of
interfaces in a subsystem. We can use this pattern to create a simplified API
for the various AI services we're using. This way, the rest of our application
doesn't need to know about the specifics of interacting with these services.
2. **Factory Pattern**: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects
in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be
created. We can use this pattern to create instances of different AI services
based on the game's needs, for instance.
3. **Singleton Pattern**: This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance
and provides a global point of access to it. However, there are few points I
consider using this pattern, such as for the service that manages the database
connections, ensuring that only one connection is active at any given time to a
specific service (URL: port) and managing connection pools.
4. **Strategy Pattern**: This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates
each one, and makes them interchangeable.
 
1. **Follow the DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. If you find yourself writing
the same code more than once, consider turning it into a function or method.
2. **Use Language Conventions**: Every languages has a set of conventions and idioms that make
code more readable and efficient.
3. **Test Your Code**: Write tests for your code to ensure it behaves as expected. This
is especially important when working with complex systems like AI and databases. 
4. **Document Your Code**: Make sure to write clear CODE which makes comments and
documentation for your code meaningless, but even that do comment whenever
you feel it is necessary."}

This project is a REST API to a table-top simulator RPG game server 
and will provide multiple services that will demand external providers,
including ChatGPT, Railway, Pinecone, Chroma dB, Whisper, TheHuggingFace,
Dall-E, and many others. Also will need to implement game managers for RPG
rules like D&D5, Pathfinder, homebrew, etc., and setup database connections
to be used as memory, and much more. This is a complex task that involves 
several components, and it would be best to approach it using a combination 
of design patterns and other good programming pratices as listed bellow.

specific service (URL: port) and managing connection pools.

4. **Strategy Pattern**: This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates 
each one, and makes them interchangeable. We can use this pattern to manage different 
game rules, for instance, allowing the game to have different pre-made game-systems 
(D&D5, D&D4, PathFinder, Cyberpunk, etc.), also we want to allow players to homebrew 
their own systems.

As for writing clean and efficient code in Python, we are going to use LangChain for 
core orchestration of models, memory, prompt templates, tools, flows etc.
We will use FastAPI  to provide the REST API interface along with auto-documentation 
and an easy integrated web testing package.

1. **Follow the DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. If you find yourself writing 
the same code more than once, consider turning it into a function or method.
2. **Use Pythonic Conventions**: Python has a set of conventions and idioms that make 
code more readable and efficient, such as list comprehensions and the use of `is` for 
identity comparison.
3. **Use LangChain's Modules**: LangChain provides several modules like Models, Prompts,
Memory, Indexes, Chains, Agents, and Callbacks. Use these modules effectively to build
your application.
4. **Leverage FastAPI's Features**: FastAPI provides several features like API VERSIONING 
and compatibility handling, dependency injection, automatic request validation, and 
asynchronous request handling. Make sure to use these features to write efficient and 
clean code.
5. **Test Your Code**: Write tests for your code to ensure it behaves as expected. This 
is especially important when working with complex systems like AI and databases. (*We 
need to decide for a good Python framework here ASAP)
6. **Document Your Code**: Make sure to write clear CODE which makes comments and 
documentation for your code meaningless, but even that do comment whenever you feel it 
makes sense! This will make it easier for others (and the future you) to understand 
what your code is doing and certainly will mean a much better code. Remember, we read 
code in a proportion around a 10:1 in relation to writing, so make it readable.
What I need you to do:
*You have access to the www via plugins to get updates on any documentation whenever 
you need.

What I have DONE:
- dev env: VS CODE + devcontainer already working
- project setup on github: https://github.com/Korck666/portal-chat-api
- production CI on railway.app + github

FIRST, I need you to create a kind of MEMORY prompt I can use to restart 
the conversation where we are if something happen to our chat session.


I need you to help me with:
- FastAPI and LangChain documentation to continue the implementation following.
- Think about evaluate the current code on git.
- Propose a better architecture using Langchain and Fast API as core of the service.
- Discuss with me for next steps...

Please, read and understand the project showed in the following repository tree.

Here's a brief evaluation of the code in the `engine` directory:

1. `database.py`: This file defines an abstract base class `Database` with a few 
abstract methods. It seems to be a part of a factory design pattern, where 
subclasses will implement the abstract methods to provide specific database 
functionality.

2. `database_descriptor.py`: This file defines a `DatabaseDescriptor` class that 
seems to hold the configuration for a database instance. It's a data class with a 
static method to create an instance from a dictionary.

3. `database_type.py`: This file defines an enumeration `DatabaseType` which is 
used to specify the type of a database.

4. `ai_service.py`: This file defines an abstract base class `AIService` with a 
few abstract methods. It seems to be a part of a factory design pattern, where 
subclasses will implement the abstract methods to provide specific AI service 
functionality.

5. `document.py`: This file defines a `Document` class. However, the class is 
currently empty and needs to be defined.

6. `document_descriptor.py`: This file defines a `DocumentDescriptor` data class 
that seems to hold the configuration for a document instance. It's a data class 
with a static method to create an instance from a dictionary.

7. `document_type.py`: This file defines an enumeration `DocumentType` which is 
used to specify the type of a document.

8. `game_system.py`: This file defines an abstract base class `GameSystem` with a 
few abstract methods. It seems to be a part of a factory design pattern, where 
subclasses will implement the abstract methods to provide specific game system 
functionality.

9. `log_level.py`: This file defines an enumeration `LogLevel` which is used to 
specify the level of logging.

10. `retriever.py`: This file defines an abstract base class `Retriever` with an 
abstract method. It seems to be a part of a factory design pattern, where 
subclasses will implement the abstract methods to provide specific retriever 
functionality.

11. `vector_database.py`: This file defines an abstract base class `VectorDatabase` 
that extends `Database` with a few more abstract methods. It seems to be a part of 
a factory design pattern, where subclasses will implement the abstract methods to 
provide specific vector database functionality.

12. `vector_database_retriever.py`: This file defines an abstract base class 
`VectorDatabaseRetriever` that extends `Retriever` with a few more abstract methods. 
It seems to be a part of a factory design pattern, where subclasses will implement
 the abstract methods to provide specific vector database retriever functionality.

In the `impl/databases/vector/descriptors` directory, you have the following:

1. `pinecone_descriptor.py`: This file defines a `PineconeDescriptor` data class that
extends the `DatabaseDescriptor` class. It includes additional fields specific to 
Pinecone, such as `api_key`, `environment`, `index_name`, `host`, `project_name`, 
`log_level`, `openapi_config`, `config`, and `kwargs`. 
It also includes a static method `from_database_descriptor` that creates a 
`PineconeDescriptor` instance from a `DatabaseDescriptor` instance.

In the `impl/databases/vector` directory, you have:
1. `pinecone_database.py`: This file defines a `PineconeDatabase` class that 
extends the `VectorDatabase` abstract base class. It provides concrete 
implementations for the abstract methods defined in `VectorDatabase`.
