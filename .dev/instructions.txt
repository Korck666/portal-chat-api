PROJECT:portal-chat-api (REST API) (python 3.10)
================================================
This project is a REST API to a table-top simulator RPG game server 
and will provide multiple serviceshat will demand external providers,
including ChatGPT, Railway, Pinecone, Chroma dB, Whisper, TheHuggingFace,
Dall-E, and many others. Also will need to implement game managers for RPG
rules like D&D5, Pathfinder, homebrew, etc., and setup database connections
to be used as memory, and much more. This is a complex task that involves 
several components, and it would be best to approach it using a combination 
of design patterns and other good programming pratices as listed bellow. 

What I have DONE:
- I have a working dev env: VS CODE + devcontainer already working
- I have a project setup on github: (latest commit)
https://github.com/Korck666/portal-chat-api/tree/9fc337a06267667c6180f3e1706a8153e8ffc0f5
- I have a working Dockerfile and a main.py with FastAPI default implementation
including a server with auto documentation (but no tests yet)
- FastAPI (web interface/documentation) -> FastAPI is used to provide the REST API 
interface along with auto-documentation and an easy integrated web testing package.
- I have RailWay setup with a working deployment of the server
- I have a working MongoDB database on Railway and a working connection to it
- I have a working server Logger with a working connection to the MongoDB database
- I have a working Pinecone database instance, but not connected to the server yet

What I have to do:
- LangChain (orchestrator) -> Langchain will be used to orchestrate all the AI services
- Pytest (test) -> For the testing framework, we will use pytest, and for the CI/CD 
we will use Github Actions.
- We will need to setup database connections to be used as memory, Pinecone and MongoDB
where the two database I chose to start with, but we will need to implement a faster 
vector in memory database to be used as a cache for the Pinecone database, and we will
use ChromaDB for that.
- Pinecone (vector memory) -> Pinecone will be used to store the vectors of the
game rules to be used as reference for the AI models. We will need to implement
a ingestion process to convert PDF and other formats to text and then to vectors
to be stored in the database.
- MongoDB (document database) -> MongoDB will be used to store the chat history and
world state of the game, user profiles, and other data that will be used by use by
different services, not only the AI services.
- OpenAi (ai models) -> OpenAi will be used to provide the AI models for many services
including: 
- text embedding model
- text reasoning model (gpt-3.5-turbo)
- text summarizer model (chatbot)
- image to text model (CLIP)
- text to image model (Dall-E2)
- text to speech model (TTS2)   
- speech to text model (whisper-1)
- prompt edit model (text-davinci-edit-001)

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
1. **Follow the DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. If you find yourself writing
the same code more than once, consider turning it into a function or method.
2. **Use Language Conventions**: Every languages has a set of conventions and idioms that make
code more readable and efficient.
3. **Test Your Code**: Write tests for your code to ensure it behaves as expected. 
4. **Document Your Code**: Do comment whenever you feel it is necessary.
5. **Break down COMPLEX TASKS if you need to. 
6. **Use more prompts if you need to in order to get the job done.
7. **Understand FastAPI and LangChain documentation and create think of a lean architecture.

4. **MongoDB documentation**: https://docs.mongodb.com/
5. **ChromaDB documentation**: https://chromadb.org/docs/

WHERE TO START:
1. ask chatwithcode to access my repository on github: https://github.com/Korck666/portal-chat-api
2. understand my project structure and the code I have already written
3. tell me what you think and what you would do differently
